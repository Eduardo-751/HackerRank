/*
Objective

This challenge will help you to learn how to take a character, a string and a sentence as input in C.

To take a single character ch as input, you can use scanf("%c", &ch ); and printf("%c", ch) writes a character specified by the argument char to stdout

char ch;
scanf("%c", &ch);
printf("%c", ch);
This piece of code prints the character .

You can take a string as input in C using scanf(“%s”, s). But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.

In order to take a line as input, you can use scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); where MAX_LEN is defined as char s[MAX_LEN] where MAX_LEN is the maximum size of s. Here, [] is the scanset character. ^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here, the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.

Note: The statement: scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s); will not work because the last statement will read a newline character, \n, from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways. One way is to use scanf("\n"); before the last statement.

Input Format

First, take a character, ch as input.
Then take the string, s as input.
Lastly, take the sentence sen as input.

Output Format

Print three lines of output. The first line prints the character, ch.
The second line prints the string, s.
The third line prints the sentence, sen.
